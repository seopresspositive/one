'The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education'
the human rights defender and journalist and victim of enforced disappearances

Considering the obligation of States under the Charter 
of the United Nations to promote universal respect for, 
and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

Aware of the extreme seriousness of enforced disappearance, which 
constitutes a crime and, in certain circumstances defined in international law, 
a crime against humanity,

Determined to prevent enforced disappearances and to combat impunity 
for the crime of enforced disappearance,

Considering the right of any person not to be subjected to enforced disappearance, 
the right of victims to justice and to reparation,

Affirming the right of any victim to know the truth 
about the circumstances of an enforced disappearance and the fate of the 
disappeared person, and the right to freedom to seek, receive and impart information to this end,

Having regard to International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance / Article 12 /

1. "Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges that a person has 
been subjected to enforced disappearance has the right to report the facts to the 
competent authorities, which shall examine the allegation promptly and impartially 
and, where necessary, undertake without delay a thorough and impartial investigation. 
Appropriate steps shall be taken, where necessary, to ensure that the complainant, 
witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person and their defence counsel, as well as 
persons participating in the investigation, are protected against all ill-treatment or 
intimidation as a consequence of the complaint or any evidence given."

'The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education' 
the human rights defender and journalist and victim of enforced disappearances alleges that a person has 
been subjected to enforced disappearance and has the right to report the facts to the 
competent authorities.

Having regard to International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance / Article 12 /

2. "Where there are reasonable grounds for believing 
that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance, 
the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall 
undertake an investigation, even if there has been no formal complaint."

Having regard to International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance / Article 12 /

4. "Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to 
prevent and sanction acts that hinder the conduct of an investigation. 
It shall ensure in particular that persons suspected of having committed an 
offence of enforced disappearance are not in a position to influence the progress
of an investigation by means of pressure or acts of intimidation or reprisal aimed
at the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person or their defence 
counsel, or at persons participating in the investigation."

"Human rights protection results when, through specific actions, individuals 
who otherwise would be at risk or subject to deprivation of their rights, are able to 
fully exercise them. It is based on international law, and necessarily focuses on both 
immediate responses where people are threatened, and on longer-term work to build and 
strengthen laws and institutions that protect rights."
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights

1.) 'The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education'
hereby present the human rights defender and journalist and victim of enforced disappearances 
analysis on the lack of full implementation of the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance by Slovakia and Slovakia's 
territory as Ambassadors of Slovakia.

2.) On 15 Dec 2014, Slovakia ratified the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

3.) According to Article 4 of the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
State Parties have the obligation to make enforced disappearance a criminal offence
under national law; Slovakia has not yet fulfilled this obligation.

4.) There are serious gaps in Slovak 
criminal law and Slovak Criminal Code 
that could prevent 
the investigation and prosecution of those 
suspected of criminal responsibility for enforced disappearance.

A.) - "Ján Kuciak submitted a criminal complaint to the Prosecutor’s 
Office after being threatened by a Slovak man, and 
subsequently stated that 44 days after the submission the case was 
not assigned to a police officer and was closed with no witness hearing held;"  
European Parliament. At the time of his death, Ján Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, both aged 27. Ján Kuciak's fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, usually spoke with her mother on a daily basis. Her mother stated that she last spoke with her daughter in the afternoon of 21 February 2018. When she tried to contact her again that evening, there was no reply. Martina Kušnírová and Ján Kuciak 
persons may have been the victims of enforced disappearance.

B.) -" whereas several attacks on journalists in Slovakia 
have been reported since 2007 and two journalist are still missing;"
European Parliament resolution of 19 April 2018 on protection of 
investigative journalists in Europe: the case of Slovak journalist 
Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová (2018/2628(RSP)) Thursday, 19 April 2018 - Strasbourg

C.) - 'The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education'
the human rights defender and journalist and victim of enforced disappearances submitted 
a criminal complaint to the Prosecutor’s 
Office after 'Humanitarian' action in the form of 
life-saving about the victims of enforced 
disappearances, after the submission the case was 
not assigned to a special officers and was closed with no witness hearing held.

5.) 'The Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education'
the human rights defender and journalist and victim of enforced disappearances have 
analyzed a number of cases that have been or could be significant for the Slovak justice system.

6.) Analysis has also been carried out based on an not fictional case scenario to determine whether
existing Slovak criminal provisions are sufficient to ensure that the appropriate investigation
and prosecution proceedings can take place.

7.) The position of  - 'Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education' -
the human rights defender and journalist and victim of enforced disappearances is 
that the criminal provisions as they currently stand in the Slovak Criminal Code do 
not adequately cover instances of the specific offence as defined 
in Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance and fail to fulfill the Slovakia’s obligation to
criminalize the conduct.

8.) The obligation to make enforced disappearance criminal under national law
Article 4 of the Convention provides that: "Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes 
an offence under its criminal law."

9.) The position of - 'Global Investigative Journalism Circle of Jan Kuciak Strategies for Human Rights Education' -
the human rights defender and journalist and victim of enforced disappearances 
are of the view that the obligation contained in Article 4 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance requires that states parties must define enforced
disappearance as a separate or independent crime.

10.) The journalists Miroslav Pejko and Palo Rypal they are simply 
missing persons on a long list of missing persons and both 
cases are being dealt with solely by the Missing Persons Unit.

11.) With new information and evidence in Miroslav Pejko's case and Palo Rypal’s case, 
we may be able to shine light on what happened having regard to 
Article 4 of the Convention provides that: "Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes 
an offence under its criminal law."

12.) Enforced disappearance is a multidimensional human rights violation and an offence comprising 
more than one act. Taken together, this collection of impingements of legal interests combine to form a new, 
additional crime which goes above and beyond these individual offences
and which conveys the specific injustice of the crime of enforced disappearance. 
It is this particular injustice which has found expression in the Convention’s [International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance] definition of the crime. 

13.) Along with the element of the arrest, 
detention, abduction or deprivation of liberty, 
enforced disappearance also involves a second act: 
refusing to acknowledge the act or the concealment of the
fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person. 
This element of injustice is not adequately reflected in Slovak 
criminal law and Slovak Criminal Code as it currently stands.

14.) *Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance defines enforced disappearance and sets out the 
elements of the offence required to determine what acts should be punishable. 

15.) *Along with arrest, detention, abduction any other form 
of deprivation of liberty, these elements also include 
acts such as the refusal to acknowledge the deprivation 
of liberty and *the concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, 
*which place such a person outside the protection of the law.

16.) *Article 6 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance, which describes the possible 
forms of perpetration (direct perpetration, *ordering, *soliciting, 
inducing the commission of or attempting to commit), taken together
with the definition contained in Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance, shows that the Convention 
pursues a very *broad concept of perpetrator. Thus, direct perpetrators 
of enforced disappearance include not only those
persons who are involved in the capture and subsequent treatment 
of the disappeared person but
also those who knowingly withhold information from *relatives of the disappeared, *victim of enforced 
disappearances
and thus facilitate the actions of the previously mentioned offenders. 

17.) This broadly conceived concept of the
perpetrator is specifically designed to include actions of administrative, judicial and police ap-
paratus which might impact on a case of enforced disappearance. This feature distinguishes the
crime of enforced disappearance from other criminal offences and criminalizes actions that sig-
nificantly contribute to facilitating the crime. *Article 7 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance clearly states that, 
taking into account the extreme seriousness of the crime, all of these persons must face punishment.

18.) Under the present
laws, this is currently not the case.
In the vast majority of cases, liability as a principal 
offender under Slovak 
criminal law and Slovak Criminal Code, applies only to those 
forms of perpetration such as unlawful imprisonment, and not 
for instance to acts of knowingly withholding information or 
concealing the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person,
and not for instance to acts of knowingly withholding information 
or concealing the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person. 
 
Under the criminal laws
currently in place, it is questionable whether prosecution could be pursued against a person who
does not directly know the principal offenders but who has knowledge of the whereabouts of a
disappeared person which, if disclosed, could uncover the crime, and does not disclose the information.

Those persons with knowledge of the whereabouts of the
disappeared person who are in a position to reveal the crime but omit to do so.

International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance
Article 12 / 4
Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to prevent and sanction 
acts that hinder the conduct of an investigation. It shall ensure in 
particular that persons suspected of having committed an offence of 
enforced disappearance are not in a position to influence the progress 
of an investigation by means of pressure or acts of intimidation or 
reprisal aimed at the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared 
person or their defence counsel, or at persons participating in the investigation.

Slovak criminal law and Slovak Criminal Code, unlike the Convention, does not consider as principal offenders those persons whose only
role in the disappearance is the withholding of information. Since, however, it is expressly
stated that these persons must be appropriately punished, the above represents a violation of
Article 7 of the Convention. This aspect alone is sufficient to necessitate the introduction of a
stand-alone criminal offence.

19.) The right to reparations
Article 24 / 4 of the Convention provides that "Each State Party shall ensure in 
its legal system that the victims of enforced disappearance have the right to obtain
 reparation and prompt, fair and adequate compensation. "
 
20.) That restriction – which is not contained in the
Convention – is inconsistent with international law and standards guaranteeing victims of hu-
man rights violations their right to a remedy.

21.) An overview of Slovak criminal law and Slovak Criminal Code shows that 
the current provisions of the Criminal Code
are not sufficient to address the specific 
injustice expressed in the definition contained in Article
2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance and 
fail to fulfill the Convention’s 
obligations related to the duty to investigate and prosecute. *
The full implementation of the Convention requires the introduction of a
new, stand alone criminal provision.
The establishment of a new criminal provision would
also send a clear signal that the implementation of the Convention is being taken seriously and
would allow the establishment of statutes of limitations of long duration, which are proportionate 
to the extreme seriousness of the offence.
This would be in line with the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances’
long-standing calls to introduce criminal provisions on enforced disappearance outside the 
context of crimes against humanity.
